Terraform Project: Creating Infrastructure with EC2 Instances, S3 Bucket, and DynamoDB Table:


Overview
This Terraform project aims to create infrastructure on AWS, including EC2 instances, S3 bucket, and DynamoDB table. 
The project leverages Terraform state and Terraform modules to create the infrastructure as code.

Prerequisites
To use this project, you need to have:

An AWS account
AWS CLI installed and configured with the AWS access and secret keys
Terraform installed on your machine

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal.
Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

terraform init
Run the following command to create a Terraform execution plan:

terraform plan
Review the plan output and make sure it matches your expectations.
Run the following command to create the infrastructure:

terraform apply
When prompted, confirm that you want to create the infrastructure.
Wait for Terraform to finish creating the infrastructure.
When done, run the following command to destroy the infrastructure:

terraform destroy
When prompted, confirm that you want to destroy the infrastructure.
Project Structure
This Terraform project is structured as follows:

main.tf: This file contains the main configuration for creating the EC2 instances, S3 bucket, and DynamoDB table.
variables.tf: This file contains the input variables for the project, such as the AWS region, instance type, and key pair.
outputs.tf: This file contains the output values for the resources created by Terraform.
modules/: This directory contains Terraform modules that can be reused in other projects.
state/: This directory contains Terraform state files, which keep track of the resources created by Terraform.ETC

Terraform State
This project uses Terraform state to store the information about the resources created by Terraform. The state is stored in an S3 bucket and managed by DynamoDB. This ensures that the Terraform state is consistent and can be shared among the team members.

Terraform Modules
This project uses Terraform modules to organize the code into reusable and composable components. The modules are defined in the modules/ directory and can be used in other projects. This makes it easier to maintain and scale the infrastructure.

Conclusion
This Terraform project demonstrates how to create infrastructure on AWS with Terraform. The project leverages Terraform state and Terraform modules to create infrastructure as code. By using Terraform, you can automate the creation and management of infrastructure, making it easier to maintain and scale.
